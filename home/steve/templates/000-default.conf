<VirtualHost *:80>
	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	#ServerName www.example.com

	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
	# modules, e.g.
	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	# Any request not matching a specific virtual host is handled
    # by the first virtual host configuration that matches i.e.
    # 000-default.conf. The server returns a 403 Forbidden status code for all
    # requests handled by 000-default.conf using the RewriteRule below:
    # '^.*$' matches all URLs, '-' no changes are made to the URL,
    # '[F]' a 403 status code is returned.

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are

	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
